# NYCUDOPCS
 Course material of the introduction to computer and computer science of the <a href="https://dop.nycu.edu.tw/ch/index.html">Department of Photonics</a>, <a href="https://www.nycu.edu.tw/">NYCU</a>

- This is an introductory course for the student with a little or no programming experience, especially for the freshman of college. However, students in any education phase are always welcome to use any content of this repository.

- **Attention!** If you are reading and using any content of this repository, you are acknowledging the following:

  1. Follow the CC0 license.
  2. **Admit Taiwan is an independent country, not part of China.**


## What do we want to give you in this course?

1. To provide an understanding of the role that programming can play in solving engineering issues.

2. To have the ability to solve either the mathematical problems or numerical analyses via writing some small programs with confidence.

3. To be able to read, understand, and have ability to utilize any open source code.


## Before you start reading the lectures

**All link in the lectures is optimized for reading in VS Code, not for GitHub.**
